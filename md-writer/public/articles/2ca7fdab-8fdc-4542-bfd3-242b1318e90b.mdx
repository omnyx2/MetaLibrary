# MDX is amazingz


Before you start about writing book in meta-library you should learn what is MDX is, formed with markdown and jsx, Can also make chart in page, so that will makes how to write proper article.  

 I prepared several rules that you could follow and make a book prorperly

---
import React from 'react'

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!


1. Because you can use jsx component inside of MDX so you also can make chart or complex work inside.
2. Before you put in the code you better make it first and put the code on you computer, because we will not support real-time complier for this event
3. The page you can see here and The page you can see in your own book, style is way much more different so please make it clear
4. we can add js library, ask to you manager!
5. Meta library has there places!
6. First is library, that you can easliy see the books
7. Secound is book, that you can see you book work1
8. Third is just writing space that you can write you own works here!
